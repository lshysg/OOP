Command-line parameters are 
passed to a program at runt-time by the operating system when the program is requested by
 another program, such as a command interpreter ("shell") like cmd.exe on Windows or bash 
on Linux and OS X. The user types a command and the shell calls the operating system to run 
the program. Exactly how this is done is beyond the scope of this article (on Windows, look up 
CreateProcess; on UNIX and UNIX-like systems look up fork(3) and exec(3) in the manual).

The uses for command-line parameters are various, but the main two are:
Modifying program behaviour - command-line parameters can be used to tell a program how you
 expect it to behave; for example, some programs have a -q (quiet) option to tell them not to output 
as much text.
Having a program run without user interaction - this is especially useful for programs that are 
called from scripts or other programs.
